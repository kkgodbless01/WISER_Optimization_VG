I just shipped a reproducible benchmarking pipeline for quantum‑inspired solvers — built on WSL/Ubuntu with Python 3.11.

What’s inside:
• End‑to‑end, documented runs (no guesswork)
• Auto‑generated comparison table (speed + accuracy)
• Recruiter‑ready README and summary

Key results (snapshot):
• • Runtime: Solver = 0.021 s vs Baseline = —
• • Accuracy: Solver = 50.000 vs Baseline = —

Full project + results:

Results table:

If you’re hiring for data, optimization, or research roles, I’d love to connect.
