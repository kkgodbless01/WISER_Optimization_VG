I just shipped a reproducible benchmarking pipeline for quantum‑inspired solvers — built on WSL/Ubuntu with Python 3.11.

What’s inside:
• End‑to‑end, documented runs (no guesswork)
• Auto‑generated comparison table (speed + accuracy)
• Recruiter‑ready README and summary

Key results (snapshot):
• Runtime: Solver = XX.XX s vs Baseline = YY.YY s
• Accuracy: Solver = XX.X% vs Baseline = YY.Y%

Full project + results:

Results table:
https://github.com/your-username/your-repo/blob/main/results/comparison_tables/solver_vs_baseline.md

If you’re hiring for data, optimization, or research roles, I’d love to connect.
