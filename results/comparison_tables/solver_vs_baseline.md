Updated: 2025-08-14 05:46:57Z

| Metric                 | Solver | Baseline |
|------------------------|:------:|:--------:|
| Average Runtime (s)    | 0.41 | 0.53 |
| Solution Accuracy (%)  | 91.7 | 82.1 |
| Speedup Factor         | 1.29× | — |

Notes:
- Accuracy derived from portfolio–target match and guardrail satisfaction (weighted blend).
- Runtimes may come from logs or solver metadata.
