# WISER Optimization VG â€” Reproducible benchmarking

## Overview
A transparent, end-to-end benchmarking pipeline for quantumâ€‘inspired solvers on WSL/Ubuntu with Python 3.11. Every stepâ€”from environment setup to metrics collectionâ€”is documented for repeatability and review.

## Highlights
- Reproducible runs with explicit dependencies and commands
- Auto-generated comparison tables for speed and accuracy
- Clear README guidance for setup, tuning, and verification

## Key results (snapshot)
| Metric                | Solver Variant | Baseline |
|-----------------------|----------------|----------|
| Average Runtime (s) | 0.41 | 0.53 |
| Solution Accuracy (%) | 91.7 | 82.1 |
| Speedup Factor | 1.29Ã— | â€” |
