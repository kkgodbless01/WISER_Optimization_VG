# WISER Optimization VG — Reproducible benchmarking

## Overview
A transparent, end-to-end benchmarking pipeline for quantum‑inspired solvers on WSL/Ubuntu with Python 3.11. Every step—from environment setup to metrics collection—is documented for repeatability and review.

## Highlights
- Reproducible runs with explicit dependencies and commands
- Auto-generated comparison tables for speed and accuracy
- Clear README guidance for setup, tuning, and verification

## Key results (snapshot)
| Metric                | Solver Variant | Baseline |
|-----------------------|----------------|----------|
| Average Runtime (s)   | XX.XX          | YY.YY    |
| Solution Accuracy (%) | None | None |
| Speedup Factor        | X.XX×          | —        |

## Reproduce quickly
1. Create the environment and install dependencies (see README).
2. Run the solver scripts to generate outputs and logs.
3. Build the comparison table and verify metrics with provided commands.
